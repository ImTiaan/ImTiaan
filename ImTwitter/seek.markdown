# Knowing Your Audience

The first thing you want to do is consider who you want to attract to your account by building a profile of the targets you want to attract. 

- Are they Professionals / Enthusiasts / Hobbyists etc. 
- Income bracket? 
- What sort of products do these people use? 
- Do they use mobile or desktops more? 
- Do they prefer a specific type of OS? 
- Are they followers of specific pollitical ideals?
- Do they follow a specific religion? 

Alternatively, you could choose a known leader within the target audience and simply go to their twitter profile. 

ðŸ‘† This will be the approach I take in this tutorial. 

Since we're using the easy way to do this in the tutorial, I'll propose that @ImTwittur wants to find great food related accounts, and wants to attract fellow food lovers to their account.

Gordon Ramsay is a pretty well known and respected chef and celebrity, so I'll start this process with him.
