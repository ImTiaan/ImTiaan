# Introduction

This project is a Chrome extension that I built to automate a Twitter account from your browser. It is built with features to control the rate of which you perform tasks and has a built in hard limit per session that reduces the likelihood of a twitter ban. 

## Features

7. Scheduling
5. Auto Follow
6. Auto UnFollow
3. Auto Retweet
4. Auto UnRetweet
1. Auto Like
2. Auto UnLike

## Software Required

1. [Chrome Browser](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwibiNCq0ejhAhVPse0KHRufB9MYABAAGgJkZw&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESQOD2jg6K8UyuYOBbGBCt8Be5gNmgLTsrM02sdsJAU0frW3VjfLdy3Aa9JmPh3V82Y8vsjwT1vI1H5sMldrdSV5E&sig=AOD64_1HvL_NuvJSVW_IxvY56buTop6AQA&q=&ved=2ahUKEwiT8Mmq0ejhAhWVoXEKHcIQBmcQ0Qx6BAgOEAE&adurl= "Download Chrome") Version 73.0.3683.103 (it may work on other versions - ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
2. ImTwitter [Extension](https://www.imtiaan.com/downloads/ImTwitter.zip "Download this Software")
3. Something to open a .Zip file

## Twitter

I would recommend that you test this extension with a new account in order to get used to Twitter's limitations and to prevent a ban of the account you actually intend to use this extension with.
I have done this with [@ImTwittur](https://twitter.com/ImTwittur).

## Installation

Unzip the file `ImTwitter.Zip`

Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` in the url bar.

![Extensions](../images/extensions.png "Extensions")

In the top right of the page that loads, turn on the developer toggle. 

![Developer](../images/developermode.png "Developer Mode")

Click on "Load Unpacked"

![Load Unpacked](../images/load.png "Load Unpacked")

Navigate to the unzipped folder and select it

The plugin should now be installed, you can verify this by seeing the spaceman logo in your chrome toolbar.
