# Introduction

This project is a Chrome extension that I built to automate a Twitter account from your browser. It is built with features to control the rate of which you perform tasks and has a built in hard limit per session that reduces the likelihood of a twitter soft ban. 

## Features

1. Auto Like
2. Auto Un Like
3. Auto Retweet
4. Auto Un Retweet
5. Auto Follow
6. Auto UnFollow
7. App Scheduling
