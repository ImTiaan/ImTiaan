## Retweets	

Retweeting takes a bit of time, so that is why we've left this task for last in your Twitter growth cycle. 

Navigate to your Twitter Feed and select "Retweet" from the menu as you did in the "[Following](/ImTwitter/liking/ "previous")" step. 

![Retweet](../images/retweet.png "Retweet")

The extension will now retweet the top 51 tweets in your feed. 

![Retweet Example](../images/retweetex.png "Retweet Example")

The reason for this is to generate some tweet history from popular accounts to legitimize the account.

As you can see, the extension handles the retweet process automatically.
