<h1>Targeted Search</h1>

## Advanced Search (main menu)

From the extensions main menu, you can create an advanced search to seriously target the posts or users that you want to interact with by selecting "Targeted Search" 

![Scheduler](../images/targeted.png "Scheduler")

These options can get pretty complex and sometimes generating a search that is too specific drastically reduces the results you generate, which makes the task at hand pretty tedious.

I would recommend following the next few steps to generate pretty decent results.
