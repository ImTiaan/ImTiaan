blockchain cuties - NO

ok so basically nothing worked 

branding all about metamask

cryptokitties works fine - would be nice if the extension at least noted it / let you know about it

erc20tx's if its not known, you cant add custome ones

process is to send an email as opposed to the metamask way (pro - regular users can do it, which is also a con, and the con is that you have to email someone and then likely attempt to converse/convince them to list it)

no private keys -  means my ERC20's are locked

no way to tell which erc's are compatible
