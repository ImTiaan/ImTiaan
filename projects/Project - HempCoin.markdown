# HempCoin 

Being one of the oldest surviving Gen 1 Cryptocurrencies, it was a complete honour to be asked to work on the relaunch of THC. I worked with the team on pruduct development, and the move from just a cryptocurrency to a focus on agriculture, medicinal marijuana stores and the idea of using a cryptocurrency in dispensaries for customers and suppliers to minimise the security expenses that these business need to employ in order to keep their staff and customers safe. I also worked on marketing and their copy.
