# RealFevr

RealFevr is a online fantasy sports platform that was launched in 2014, since then they have been looking for a way in which to monetize their platform. I worked with the team to develop a prototype of a crypto-fueled version of the platform that not only allowed for wagering between users who compete in the same fantasy league, but also to use a token such as ERC721's to provide "ownership" of players, and in game player trading much like actual football teams would. The product is due for release in 2019.
