# World Health Organization

Infection prevention and control (IPC) is a scientific approach and practical solution designed to prevent harm caused by infection to patients and health workers. It is grounded in infectious diseases, epidemiology, social science and health system strengthening. IPC occupies a unique position in the field of patient safety and quality universal health coverage since it is relevant to health workers and patients at every single health-care encounter. 

I worked with the Dev 200 team to plan, build and develop a mobile application for iOS and Android to be deployed throughout Africa to educate people on infection and disease prevention.
