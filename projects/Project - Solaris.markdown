Solaris was originally built as an environmentally friendly cryptocurrency. In late 2017, the decision was taken to re-think the currency and its features and I was taken on board to assist in developing the team's vision for a privacy coin. I worked alongside the team on branding, the whitepaper, marketing and product feature development. The coin successfully relaunched in 2018.
