# BeatzCoin

BeatzCoin is a platform for creators to upload, store, market, rent and sell their content to users with the added benefits of being able to crowdfund and sell merchandise and event tickets directly to their subscribers and fans. Users can view or listen to content created by artists on your desktop or mobile wherein creators and users are able to earn and spend revenue in a fair system that is user and creator centric.

John McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1101882160720560128" target="0"> tweeted </a> about this project, and being the writer and product developer behind many of the concepts in the whitepaper, I think it's pretty cool!
