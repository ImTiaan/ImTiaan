# PIMeo

PIMeo, a tool for workers on construction sites and in the civil engineering sector to accurately calculate costs, materials required and perform other engineering calculations as well as a full project management suite that provides users with tools for the Agile and PRINCE2 methodologies to manage multi-million euro construction projects was brought to our team at Dev200. I worked with the client to develop their concepts, calculations and user interface to ensure that the software was easily useable by anyone, regardless of their technological experience level.
