# Education

Having spent 9 years focussing Operations and Marketing in the Oil and Gas Industry, I left the space in 2017 and focussed on building experience in software development and design. 

This journey started in 2015 with the incorporation of Dev 200 in Cape Town, South Africa with a close friend. The company is still active today and has delivered large scale projects for clients like the World Health Organization. In 2018 I stepped back from the business on a operational level to pursue my interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
