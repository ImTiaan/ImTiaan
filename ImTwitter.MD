# ImTwitter Chrome Extension

_Note: This project is in progress, I will make the download and repository active once I have completed the documentation on this site_

This project is a Chrome extension that I built to automate a Twitter account from your browser. It is built with features to control the rate of which you perform tasks and has a built in hard limit per session that reduces the likelihood of a twitter soft ban. 

## Features

7. Scheduling
5. Auto Follow
6. Auto UnFollow
3. Auto Retweet
4. Auto UnRetweet
1. Auto Like
2. Auto UnLike
